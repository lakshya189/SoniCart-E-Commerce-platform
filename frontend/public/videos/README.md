# Promotional Video Setup

## Video Requirements

To add your promotional video background, place your video files in this directory:

### Supported Formats:
- **MP4** (recommended): `promotional-video.mp4`
- **WebM** (for better compression): `promotional-video.webm`

### Video Specifications:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (loops automatically)
- **File Size**: Keep under 10MB for optimal loading
- **Codec**: H.264 for MP4, VP9 for WebM

### Recommended Content:
- Product showcases
- Brand lifestyle shots
- Seasonal promotions
- Customer testimonials
- Behind-the-scenes footage

### Optimization Tips:
1. Compress video to reduce file size
2. Use WebM format for better compression
3. Keep video content simple and not too distracting
4. Ensure good contrast for text readability

### Fallback:
If video fails to load, the hero section will automatically fall back to the original gradient background.

## Example Video Sources:
- Record your own promotional content
- Use stock video services (Pexels, Pixabay, etc.)
